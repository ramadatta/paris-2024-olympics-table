### Performance Metrics
- **Gold %**: Percentage of total medals that are gold (indicates medal quality)
- **Medal Score**: Weighted average where Gold=3pts, Silver=2pts, Bronze=1pt, divided by total medals
- **Efficiency**: Total medals per unique athlete (measures team depth and performance per capita)

### Visual Design
- Top 3 nations highlighted with gold, silver, and bronze rank backgrounds
- Country flags displayed using Unicode emoji (universal compatibility)
- Olympic blue color scheme (#0055A4)
- Clean, readable typography with proper spacing

## 📈 Data Source

**Dataset**: [Paris 2024 Olympic Summer Games](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/piterfm/paris-2024-olympic-summer-games)  

### Data Processing Steps

1. **Medal aggregation**: Grouped by country and medal type
2. **Athlete counts**: Unique athlete codes per country from athletes.csv
3. **Efficiency calculation**: Total medals ÷ unique athletes
4. **Score calculation**: (Gold×3 + Silver×2 + Bronze×1) ÷ Total medals
5. **Ranking**: Sorted by gold count, then silver, then bronze (official IOC method)

## 🎨 Design Decisions

### Why These Metrics?
- **Gold %**: Shows medal quality - countries with higher percentages excel in their strongest events
- **Medal Score**: Weighted system reflects that gold medals are more prestigious
- **Efficiency**: Normalizes for team size - shows which nations get most from their athletes

### Why This Layout?
- **Podium colors**: Makes top 3 instantly recognizable
- **No redundant visualizations**: Each element serves a purpose
- **Clear hierarchy**: Medal counts → Performance metrics → Context (disciplines)

### Why These Colors?
- Olympic blue (#0055A4) from official Olympic branding
- Actual medal colors for data columns (#FFD700, #C0C0C0, #CD7F32)
- Subtle backgrounds to avoid overwhelming the data

## 🏆 Contest Submission
